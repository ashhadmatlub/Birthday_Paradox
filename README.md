# 🎉 Birthday Paradox Simulator

This project demonstrates the famous **Birthday Paradox** 🗓️ — the surprising probability that in a group of just 23 people, there’s more than a 50% chance that at least two share the same birthday!  

The program generates random birthdays for a given number of people and checks if any duplicates exist.
